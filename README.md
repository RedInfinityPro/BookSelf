## 📖 Description
This JavaScript code snippet demonstrates the creation of a BookShelf - Digital Library using a JFrame framework. The class includes components like a container, menu components, and a UIManager. The application initializes components, sets menu bars, adds components to the frame, and adds a status bar. The UIManager is used to set custom UI properties. The class Application$1 implements Runnable and can be run using the public void run() method. The class Application$BookButton creates a book button and various properties, including background, layout, and border. The application displays a list of books in a specific order, using various java.awt.Color, java.awt.FlowLayout, java.awt.Font, javax.swing.BorderFactory, javax.swing.JButton, javax.swing.JLabel, javax.swing.JMenu, javax.swing.JMenuBar, javax.swing.JMenuItem, javax.swing.JPanel, and javax.swing.JTextField. The application also implements a search bar panel, allowing users to search for books by title, price, and other attributes. The class BookButton extends JButton and includes a paintComponent component for creating a book cover.

The class BookCoverButton extends JPanel and implements Java awt and javax.swing components to create BookCoverButton elements, set preferred size, content area, border, and focus. It also includes paintComponent, drawCenteredString, and drawCenteredString with FontMetrics, FontMetrics, and ArrayList. The class BooksDisplay extends JPanel and includes components like a JFrame parentFrame, JScrollPane scrollPane, JPanel buttonPanel, and controlPanel. It defines genres, authors, and book colors for the displayed books. The code imports javax.swing.SwingUtilities and creates a public class called Main, which invokes the SwingUtilities method later on. The class MainDisplay extends JPanel and includes a JLabel title and a JTextField searchBar. The class MenuComponents class initializes the MenuBar, adds various items, and adds the JMenu to the MenuBar. The class also includes a FileReader class, Security Menu, Help menu, and MessageDialog. The class MultiLevelComboBox implements a FlowLayout and JFrame with multiple options for selecting items.

## 🚀 Features
The project includes UI panels for business entries, rocket content classes, weighted random distribution, UI buttons, rocket upgrades, planet store and content, panel layout, and business name generation. The `pygame` library is used to create adaptable and visually interactive code. The panel layout includes top, details, and bottom sections. The code can be optimized for further functionality, and further customization is available.
